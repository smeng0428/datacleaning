using read_table function to import the data of training and testing.
using cbind and rbind to merge the data of training and testing.
the objects are as following:
1. import data
  * features: 561 obs. of 2 variables. list of all the variable of the data
  * trainSubject: 7352 obs. of 1 variable. all the subject in train data
  * x_train: 7352 obs of 561 variables. the measurements of train data
  * y_train: 7352 obs of 1 variable. the activity code of train data
  * testSubject: 2947 obs of 1 variable. list of all the subject in the test data
  * x_test: 2947 obs of 561 variable. all the measurements of the test data
  * y_test: 2947 obs of 1 varaibel. the acticity code of the test data
 
2. merging data
  * x_data: 10299obs of 561 variable. the combined data of the measurements
  * y_data: 10299obs of 1 variable. the combined activity codes of the data
  * totaSubject: 10299obs of 1 variable. the combined subjects of the data
  *rawData:10299obs of 563 variables. the combined dataset.

3. extract data
  * cleanData:10299 obs of 88 variables. the data which only contrains mean and std.
 
4. using descriptive activities names and variable names.
  * activity_label: 6obs of 2 variables. the reference of how to change activity codes to description
  * cleanData2: 10299 obs of 88 variables. changed the acitites from code to description. subsequently, changed the variable names to be more descriptive.
  
  
5.create dataset with the average of each variable for each subject 
  * cleanData3: 180obes of 88 variables. grouped the data by subject and activites. subsequently, calculated the mean of each variable.
